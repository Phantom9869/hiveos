## Completed

**Phase 1 — 2026-09-18**

- WebSocket API `hiveos-ws` + Router Lambda `hiveos-router` in `template.yaml`
- `$connect` writes a `CONN#` row and broadcasts `user_joined`; `$disconnect` deletes it and broadcasts `user_left`
- `backend/shared/broadcast.py` — fan-out with the mandatory GoneException branch
- `backend/shared/state.py` — single-table access, Decimal-safe JSON, `state_snapshot()`
- `$default` handles `hello` (→ `state_snapshot`) and `send_message` (→ `chat_message`)
- `execute-api:ManageConnections` granted on the Router role
- `scripts/ws_smoke.py` — 14-check end-to-end harness against deployed AWS
- `samconfig.toml` created and committed (was missing; see below)

**Verified against deployed AWS, not exit codes** — `python scripts/ws_smoke.py`, 14/14:

| Check | Result |
|---|---|
| `state_snapshot` has every field a cold client renders from | ✅ |
| Snapshot reports both slots `IDLE`, budget `0/1000000` | ✅ |
| Two clients connected; `user_joined` delivered to the other | ✅ |
| **One client's message reached both clients** | ✅ Phase 1 gate |
| Sender resolved from the `CONN#` row, not the frame | ✅ |
| **Broadcast past a dead connection still delivered to live clients** | ✅ Phase 1 gate |
| **GoneException branch deleted the stale `CONN#` row** | ✅ Phase 1 gate |
| Unknown action / malformed JSON return `error`, socket survives | ✅ |
| No `CONN#` rows leak after everyone disconnects | ✅ |

CloudWatch confirms the branch fired rather than the test merely passing:

```
[broadcast] gone connection=gaylUe9avQAYKEixkA== — deleting CONN# row
[broadcast] event=chat_message delivered=2 stale=1
```

No traceback anywhere in the run.

**Phase 0 — 2026-09-18** (commits `32fd214`, `f303cba`)

- Repository scaffold: 8 docs + SAM template
- AWS credentials configured; root keys retired in favour of IAM user `hiveos-dev`
- Anthropic use-case form submitted and confirmed cleared
- SAM CLI 1.166.2 installed; Docker 29.7.2 running
- Stack `hiveos` deployed to `us-east-1` — **deployment pipeline proven**
- `scripts/seed.sh` — idempotent seed/reset for demo state
- Seeded `TEAM#alpha` metadata + both agent slots `IDLE`
- AWS Budget `hiveos-guardrail` ($20, 80% alert)
- Public GitHub repo created and pushed

**Verified against deployed AWS, not exit codes:**

| Check | Result |
|---|---|
| `sts get-caller-identity` | `user/hiveos-dev` |
| `sam validate --lint` | valid |
| CloudFormation stack status | `CREATE_COMPLETE` |
| `put-item` / `get-item` round trip | item returned correctly |
| Atomic `ADD tokens_used` | returned new total `1234` — `CONTRACT.md` pattern works |
| `seed.sh` re-run | idempotent, table state correct |

## Blocked

| Blocker | Blocks | Status |
|---|---|---|
| **No card on the AWS account — AWS Marketplace cannot subscribe Bedrock third-party models** | Phase 3 only | Needs the user to add a credit/debit card |

### ✅ CORRECTED DIAGNOSIS (2026-09-18, verified in the AWS Console)

**The "Free Plan" theory below was wrong. There is no Paid Plan to upgrade to on this
account, and chasing one is a dead end. Do not re-open it.**

Verified directly in the console (Console Home, Billing Home, Account, Free Tier, Getting
Started, notifications) — **no Free Plan / Paid Plan UI exists anywhere on this account**:

| Evidence | Finding |
|---|---|
| Service provider | **Amazon Web Services India Private Limited (AISPL)** — not AWS Inc. |
| Account created | 2026-04-27, verified (`CUSTOMER VERIFICATION SUCCESS`), currency INR |
| Console Home | **No Free Plan banner** — Free Plan accounts always show one |
| Free Tier page | Legacy model (`AWS Free Usage Tier`, "Always Free"), not credits-based Free Plan |
| Account page | No plan section, no upgrade CTA |
| Credits | **$254.62 active** (incl. $100 WeMakeDevs, expires 2027-07-31) |
| Real spend | $0.46 MTD / $0.84 last month — the account bills normally |

**The actual blocker is the payment instrument:**

| Evidence | Finding |
|---|---|
| Payment methods | **1 of 1 — UPI AutoPay (GooglePay). No credit or debit card.** |
| Backup payment method | Disabled |
| AWS Marketplace active subscriptions | **0 — "You have no subscriptions"** |
| Anthropic / AI21 invoke | `AccessDeniedException: INVALID_PAYMENT_INSTRUMENT` |
| Bedrock Model access page | "For models served from **AWS Marketplace**, a user … must invoke the model once to enable it" |

Anthropic, AI21 and Mistral on Bedrock are served **through AWS Marketplace**. Marketplace
will not complete a subscription with UPI as the only instrument — it requires a card. That
is precisely what `INVALID_PAYMENT_INSTRUMENT` reports, and why the subscription list is empty.

**Unresolved residue — do not claim the card fixes everything.** `us.amazon.nova-lite-v1:0`
is first-party, needs no Marketplace subscription, and *still* fails with
`ThrottlingException: Too many tokens per day` against a zero quota. Plausibly the same root
(no payment-verified Bedrock entitlement), but that is inference, not proof. If Nova still
throttles after a card verifies, it is an AWS Support ticket, not a config fix.

**Action required (user only — Claude must not enter card details):** add a credit/debit card
at `https://console.aws.amazon.com/billing/home#/paymentpreferences`, then re-run the
verification command in *Manual actions pending*.

---

### ⛔ SUPERSEDED — original Bedrock quota investigation (2026-09-18)

> Kept for the quota data, which is still accurate and still reproduces. The *conclusion*
> ("account on the AWS Free Plan") is **wrong** — see the corrected diagnosis above.

Every model invocation fails `ThrottlingException: Too many tokens per day`, including
models with non-zero per-minute quota. Root cause in Service Quotas (1123 quotas inspected):

| Finding | Value |
|---|---|
| Per-model **per-day** token quotas at zero | **42 of 44** |
| Of those, **adjustable** | **0** — `adjustable=False`, cannot be raised by request |
| Anthropic token quotas non-zero | 0 of 21 |
| Amazon Nova token quotas non-zero | 0 of 33 |
| Account pool `L-E3F10727` | 150,000,000/day, `adjustable=False`, not the binding limit |
| Only tpm headroom | GPT-5.6 Terra/Luna/Sol (bedrock-mantle), AI21 Jamba 1.5 (3k tpm) |

Tested empirically — two different vendors, identical failure:

```
us.anthropic.claude-haiku-4-5-20251001-v1:0   ThrottlingException: Too many tokens per day
ai21.jamba-1-5-mini-v1:0                      ThrottlingException: Too many tokens per day
```

**Not** a permissions, model-access, or use-case-form problem — all three are resolved.
~~Hard zeros that cannot be raised via Service Quotas indicate an account still on the AWS
**Free Plan**.~~ **← WRONG. Superseded by the corrected diagnosis above: the account is
AISPL and has no Free/Paid plan concept; the binding failure is the missing card.**

**Decision (user, 2026-09-18):** proceed with Phases 1–2, which need no Bedrock. If a card is
added and Bedrock unlocks, real Bedrock drops into Phase 3 unchanged. If not, fall back per
`ARCHITECTURE.md` decision 7.

#### Re-check after Phase 1 (2026-09-18) — error signature changed, quotas did not

Still **not** on the Paid Plan. Quotas are byte-for-byte identical to the first
investigation: 1123 quotas, **42 of 43 per-day token quotas at zero, 0 adjustable**, only
the 150,000,000 `Cross-Model Account-Level Tokens Per Day` pool non-zero.

What *did* change is the error for third-party models:

| Model | Before | Now |
|---|---|---|
| `us.anthropic.claude-haiku-4-5` | `ThrottlingException: Too many tokens per day` | `AccessDeniedException: INVALID_PAYMENT_INSTRUMENT` |
| `ai21.jamba-1-5-mini` | `ThrottlingException: Too many tokens per day` | `AccessDeniedException: INVALID_PAYMENT_INSTRUMENT` |
| `us.amazon.nova-lite-v1:0` | — | `ThrottlingException: Too many tokens per day` (unchanged) |

```
Model access is denied due to INVALID_PAYMENT_INSTRUMENT: A valid payment
instrument must be provided.. Your AWS Marketplace subscription for this model
cannot be completed at this time.
```

The split is diagnostic. Third-party models need an AWS Marketplace subscription, which
requires a valid payment instrument — that is now the binding failure. Amazon's own Nova
needs no subscription, so it falls straight through to the Free Plan per-day quota of zero.

**Conclusion: the upgrade did not complete. The card on the account is missing, declined,
or unverified.** Fixing the payment instrument is the prerequisite; the plan upgrade cannot
complete without it. There is no AWS API that reports plan tier directly — this is inferred
from quota state plus the two error signatures.

**Impact is confined to Phase 3.** Phase 2 already specifies a stub agent, so the queue,
slot scheduler, token accounting, WebSocket sync and the deployed URL are all buildable now.

---

## Resolved

- **Anthropic use-case form** — submitted, gate cleared. Proven by the error changing from
  `ResourceNotFoundException` ("use case details have not been submitted") to a quota throttle.
- **IAM permissions** — `AdministratorAccess` attached to `hiveos-dev`. Proven by the error
  changing from `AccessDeniedException` to a quota throttle.
- **Root access keys retired** — now using IAM user credentials.

---

## Manual actions pending

1. **Add a credit or debit card to the AWS account.** There is no Paid Plan upgrade to do —
   that theory was checked in the console and disproved. The card is the whole blocker.
   - `https://console.aws.amazon.com/billing/home#/paymentpreferences` → **Add payment
     method** → card. UPI AutoPay is currently the only method and AWS Marketplace does not
     accept it.
   - Claude cannot do this step — entering payment credentials is off-limits.
   - Verify: `aws bedrock-runtime converse --region us-east-1 --model-id us.anthropic.claude-haiku-4-5-20251001-v1:0 --messages '[{"role":"user","content":[{"text":"Say OK"}]}]' --inference-config '{"maxTokens":10}'`
     must return a completion, not `INVALID_PAYMENT_INSTRUMENT` or `ThrottlingException`.
   - Unblocks Phase 3 only. Phase 2 does not need it.
2. **Confirm AWS Budget notification email** — check `arunishrajput7@gmail.com` for the
   `hiveos-guardrail` subscription confirmation.

## Known issues and discoveries

- **`state_snapshot` cannot be pushed from `$connect`.** API Gateway does not finish
  establishing the connection until the `$connect` integration returns, so
  `post_to_connection` against it fails with `GoneException`. `BUILD_PLAN.md` Phase 1
  task 5 said "sent immediately on `$connect`". Corrected: the client sends
  `{"action":"hello"}` on socket open and the server replies with the snapshot. Same
  behaviour, one extra ~50 ms round trip. `CONTRACT.md` documents the handshake.
- **`send_message` had no matching server event.** Added `chat_message`
  `{user_id, text, ts}` to `CONTRACT.md`.
- **`samconfig.toml` was missing from the repository.** Phase 0's `sam deploy --guided`
  writes it, but it was never committed, so `sam deploy` had no config to read. Created
  and committed — it holds no secrets. Do not run `--guided` again; it would overwrite it.
- **Only `$connect` / `$disconnect` / `$default` routes exist**, with
  `RouteSelectionExpression: $request.body.action`. Every action lands in one handler, so
  new actions are code changes only. This matters because `AWS::ApiGatewayV2::Deployment`
  is an immutable route-table snapshot — adding a route later requires renaming that
  resource's logical ID (noted in `template.yaml`).
- **Lambda packaging:** both functions build from `CodeUri: backend/` with handlers like
  `router.app.lambda_handler`, so `shared/` is importable as a top-level package. No layer.
- **DynamoDB returns `Decimal`** and `json.dumps` rejects it. Every outbound frame goes
  through `state.dumps()`.
- **Bedrock *Model access* page is retired.** Serverless models auto-enable on first invoke
  across all commercial regions. The Anthropic use-case form now lives as a banner on the
  **Model catalog** page, not Model access. `DEPLOYMENT.md` Manual Action 2 reflects this.
- **Local Python is 3.14**, newer than any Lambda runtime. Compiled dependencies would get
  wrong-platform wheels if built locally. **Always `sam build --use-container`.**
- **npm global prefix `~/.local/lib` does not exist** — `npm install -g` may fail. Use `npx`.
- **AWS CLI `configure` cannot run** through the `!` prefix in Claude Code (no TTY). Interactive
  AWS commands must be run in a normal terminal.

## Next recommended action

**Start Phase 2 — Scheduler and queue (no LLM).** The highest-value phase: the queue
mechanic *is* the product. Add the SQS queue + DLQ and the Agent Runner Lambda, implement
`claim_agent` with the atomic conditional update from `CONTRACT.md`, enqueue a `QUEUE#`
item when both slots are taken, and release in `try/finally` so a failing task never
leaks a slot.

The broadcast layer it needs is already deployed and verified — `broadcast_to_team()` and
`state_snapshot()` in `backend/shared/` are ready to use. Extend `scripts/ws_smoke.py`
with the Phase 2 gate checks (third claim queues, auto-dispatch on release, no slot leak
on failure).

Nothing in Phase 2 depends on Bedrock.
